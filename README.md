Simple script to generate Apollo (Sunshine) links for Beacon launcher on Android.

Requirements: Python needs to be installed.

To run, edit the settings.ini to point to your Apollo apps.json and also set the output directory. Then run GenerateLinks.bat and move the corresponding files to your Android device. 

From there it's as simple as adding a new custom platform in Beacon, point it to Artemis (or Moonlight might work although is untested) and set the roms folder as the folder containing these files.
